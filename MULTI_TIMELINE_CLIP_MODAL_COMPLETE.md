3. **Mini Video Preview** - Video player with timeline scrubbers for each clip
4. **Flexible Input** - Both drag controls and numeric entry for start/end times
5. **Live Duration Display** - Real-time calculation with MM:SS.millisecond formatting
6. **Clear Labeling** - Clips labeled as "Clip 1", "Clip 2", etc. with distinct highlights
7. **Overlap Detection** - Configurable warnings with visual indicators
8. **Scalable Layout** - Usable interface supporting up to 10 clips with scrolling
9. **Backend Integration** - Sends ordered array of {start, end} pairs to API
10. **Auto-Distribution** - "Evenly distribute" button for automatic clip spacing

### üöÄ **Enhanced Features**

```typescript
interface ClipSegment {
  id: string;
  label: string;
  startTime: number;
  endTime: number;
  duration: number;
  title?: string;
  description?: string;
  hashtags?: string;
  hasOverlap?: boolean;
}
```
