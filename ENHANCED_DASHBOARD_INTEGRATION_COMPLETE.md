## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### File Structure
```
src/components/dashboard/
├── modern-dashboard.tsx       # Main dashboard with responsive logic
├── enhanced-dashboard.tsx     # Desktop-optimized component
├── advanced-analytics.tsx     # Interactive analytics charts
└── mobile-dashboard.tsx       # Mobile-optimized component
```

### Dependencies Used
- **Framer Motion**: Advanced animations and gestures
- **Recharts**: Interactive data visualization
- **React Intersection Observer**: Scroll-based animations
- **Heroicons**: Consistent icon system
- **Tailwind CSS**: Responsive design system

### Device Detection Logic
```typescript
const [isMobile, setIsMobile] = useState(false)

useEffect(() => {
  const checkMobile = () => {
    setIsMobile(window.innerWidth < 768)
  }
  
  checkMobile()
  window.addEventListener('resize', checkMobile)
  return () => window.removeEventListener('resize', checkMobile)
}, [])
```

### Conditional Rendering
```typescript
{activeTab === 'dashboard' && (
  isMobile ? (
    <MobileDashboard {...mobileProps} />
  ) : (
    <EnhancedDashboard {...desktopProps} />
  )
)}
```
