### üîß Quick Start Commands

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Configure environment
cp env.template .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your OAuth credentials

# 3. Generate encryption key
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"

# 4. Setup database
npx prisma db push

# 5. Generate Prisma client (if timeout issues resolve)
npx prisma generate

# 6. Start development server
npm run dev

# 7. Test OAuth flows at http://localhost:3000/dashboard/social
```

### üö® Known Issues

1. **Prisma Client Generation**: Timeout issues during generation
   - **Impact**: TypeScript types may not be available
   - **Workaround**: Database schema is correctly pushed and functional
   - **Fix**: Retry generation or use alternative methods

### üéØ Immediate Next Steps

1. **Complete OAuth App Setup** (1-2 hours)
   - Follow OAUTH_SETUP_GUIDE.md
   - Configure each platform's developer portal
   - Set up redirect URIs for production

2. **Environment Configuration** (30 minutes)
   - Generate encryption key
   - Configure all OAuth credentials
   - Set production environment variables

3. **Testing Phase** (2-3 hours)
   - Test OAuth flows for each platform
   - Verify publishing functionality
   - Test scheduled posting
   - Validate UI components

4. **Production Deployment** (varies by hosting platform)
