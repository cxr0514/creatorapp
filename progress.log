🚧 BACKLOG / FUTURE
- Enhanced video processing with FFmpeg
- Batch clip creation
- Advanced clip editing features
- SEO & metadata generation
- Social media sharing
- Analytics dashboard

------------------------------------------------------------
🧠 NOTES / GOTCHAS
- Authentication using JWT sessions (no database adapter needed)
- Google OAuth redirect URI: http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google
- Video processing currently simulated - needs FFmpeg integration
- User-specific Cloudinary uploads: videos/{userId} and clips/{userId} folders
- User ID from JWT token used for authorization in API routes
- Database connection works but Prisma adapter had issues (solved with JWT)
- Database schema uses integer IDs for videos/clips for better performance
- Cloudinary manual configuration (no upload preset) for folder control

------------------------------------------------------------
🎯 NEXT PRIORITIES
1. Implement real video processing with FFmpeg or similar
2. Add proper error boundaries and loading states
3. Enhance UI/UX with better feedback and animations
4. Add video thumbnail generation and preview features

------------------------------------------------------------
🎯 PROGRESS UPDATE: Enhanced UI/UX Implementation

   - PRD Reference: "Choose aspect ratio (9:16, 1:1, 16:9, etc.) for each clip"
   - Added aspect ratio selection (16:9, 9:16, 1:1, 4:3)
   - Added clip count input (1-10 clips per video)
   - Added platform-specific optimization hints for each aspect ratio
   - Enhanced with timeline scrubber for better time selection
