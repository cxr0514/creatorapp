🔧 CRITICAL BUG FIX: Google OAuth & Prisma Import Issues RESOLVED
📅 DATE: 2025-06-04 (UTC)
🚨 ISSUE TYPE: Authentication & Server Compilation Errors

✅ RESOLVED ISSUES:

1. GOOGLE OAUTH ROUTE CONFLICT - FIXED
   - Problem: Custom OAuth callback route `/api/auth/callback/[platform]/route.ts` was intercepting NextAuth's Google OAuth
   - Symptom: Users redirected back to login screen with `oauth_error=unsupported_platform&platform=google` error
   - Root Cause: Route conflict between NextAuth Google OAuth handler and custom social media OAuth handlers
   - Solution: Moved custom OAuth callbacks from `/api/auth/callback/[platform]` to `/api/social/oauth/callback/[platform]`
   - Result: Google OAuth now works correctly with successful user authentication flow

2. PRISMA CLIENT IMPORT ERRORS - FIXED  
   - Problem: Incorrect default imports across 15+ API route files preventing server compilation
   - Symptom: Build errors with "Cannot access 'prisma' before initialization" and import errors
   - Root Cause: Using `import prisma from '@/lib/prisma'` instead of `import { prisma } from '@/lib/prisma'`
   - Solution: Updated all API routes to use correct named import pattern
   - Result: Server starts cleanly with no compilation errors

📁 FILES MODIFIED:

ROUTE RESTRUCTURING:
- `/src/app/api/auth/callback/[platform]/route.ts` → MOVED to `/src/app/api/social/oauth/callback/[platform]/route.ts`
- `/src/lib/oauth-config.ts` - Updated all social media redirect URIs to new callback path

PRISMA IMPORT FIXES (15+ files):
- `/src/app/api/admin/users/route.ts` - Fixed Prisma import
- `/src/app/api/admin/users/[userId]/route.ts` - Fixed Prisma import
- `/src/app/api/admin/audit-logs/route.ts` - Fixed Prisma import
- `/src/app/api/subscriptions/checkout/route.ts` - Fixed Prisma import
- `/src/app/api/subscriptions/webhook/route.ts` - Fixed Prisma import

- `/src/app/api/admin/support/tickets/route.ts` - Fixed Prisma import
- `/src/app/api/admin/support/tickets/[ticketId]/route.ts` - Fixed Prisma import
- `/src/app/api/subscriptions/current/route.ts` - Fixed Prisma import
- `/src/app/api/workspaces/invite/route.ts` - Fixed Prisma import
- `/src/app/api/support/tickets/route.ts` - Fixed Prisma import

🔧 TECHNICAL CHANGES:

OAuth Configuration Updates:
```typescript
// Updated all social media platforms in oauth-config.ts
redirectUri: process.env.NEXTAUTH_URL + '/api/social/oauth/callback/youtube'
redirectUri: process.env.NEXTAUTH_URL + '/api/social/oauth/callback/tiktok'
redirectUri: process.env.NEXTAUTH_URL + '/api/social/oauth/callback/instagram'
redirectUri: process.env.NEXTAUTH_URL + '/api/social/oauth/callback/twitter'
redirectUri: process.env.NEXTAUTH_URL + '/api/social/oauth/callback/linkedin'
```

Prisma Import Pattern Fix:
```typescript
// OLD (incorrect - causing build errors)
import prisma from '@/lib/prisma';

// NEW (correct - working)
import { prisma } from '@/lib/prisma';
```

📊 VERIFICATION & TESTING:
- Created comprehensive test scripts to verify OAuth route separation
- Confirmed Google OAuth working correctly with successful user authentication
- Verified server starts cleanly with no compilation errors  
- Tested NextAuth Google provider configuration

## Latest Update: December 19, 2024 - CLOUDINARY TO BACKBLAZE B2 MIGRATION COMPLETE

### MAJOR MIGRATION: Cloudinary → Backblaze B2 Storage
**Status: ✅ COMPLETED**

**Migration Overview:**
- Completely replaced all Cloudinary functionality with Backblaze B2 (S3-compatible API)
- Maintained all existing features while reducing storage costs significantly
- Updated all API routes, components, and utility functions
- Preserved database schema compatibility by using generic storage fields

**Files Modified/Created:**

1. **New B2 Library** - `src/lib/b2.ts`
   - Created comprehensive B2 storage library using AWS SDK v3
   - Functions: uploadToB2, getPresignedUrl, deleteFromB2, fileExists
   - Template asset management: uploadTemplateAsset, deleteTemplateAsset
   - Video processing functions: generateVideoThumbnail, generateClipThumbnail, applyStyleTemplate
   - Smart cropping support: generateVideoTransformation

2. **API Routes Updated:**
   - `src/app/api/clips/[id]/export/route.ts` - Replaced Cloudinary with B2 for clip exports
   - `src/app/api/clips/batch-export/route.ts` - Updated batch export to use B2 storage
   - `src/app/api/templates/upload/route.ts` - Template asset uploads now use B2
   - `src/app/api/templates/route.ts` - Updated interface to use storageKey instead of cloudinaryId
   - `src/app/api/templates/[id]/route.ts` - Updated template update interface

3. **Library Updates:**
   - `src/lib/queues/caption-queue.ts` - Caption processing now uses B2 storage
   - `src/lib/video-export.ts` - Replaced generateCloudinaryTransformation with generateVideoTransformation
   - `src/lib/smart-cropping-engine.ts` - Updated to generate B2-compatible transformations
   - **DELETED:** `src/lib/cloudinary.ts` - Completely removed Cloudinary library

4. **Configuration Updates:**
   - `next.config.ts` - Updated image domains from Cloudinary to B2 endpoint
   - `env.template` - Added B2 environment variables, removed Cloudinary vars
   - `README.md` - Updated documentation for B2 setup and configuration

5. **Dependencies:**
   - Added: `@aws-sdk/lib-storage` for multipart uploads
   - Existing: `@aws-sdk/client-s3` and `@aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner` (already installed)
   - Removed: All Cloudinary dependencies (none were in package.json)

**Environment Variables Changed:**
```env
# REMOVED Cloudinary variables:
# CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME
# CLOUDINARY_API_KEY  
# CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET

# ADDED B2 variables:
B2_BUCKET_NAME=clipverse
B2_KEY_ID=005b6bd484783950000000001
B2_APP_KEY=K005wJjnrNFqY9RjzW7Ew6bURb6LoW0
