------------------------------------------------------------
🚧 BACKLOG / FUTURE
- Enhanced video processing with FFmpeg
- Batch clip creation
- Advanced clip editing features
- SEO & metadata generation
- Social media sharing
- Analytics dashboard

------------------------------------------------------------
🧠 NOTES / GOTCHAS
- Authentication using JWT sessions (no database adapter needed)
- Google OAuth redirect URI: http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google
- Video processing currently simulated - needs FFmpeg integration
- User-specific Cloudinary uploads: videos/{userId} and clips/{userId} folders
- User ID from JWT token used for authorization in API routes
- Database connection works but Prisma adapter had issues (solved with JWT)
- Database schema uses integer IDs for videos/clips for better performance
- Cloudinary manual configuration (no upload preset) for folder control

------------------------------------------------------------
🎯 NEXT PRIORITIES
1. Implement real video processing with FFmpeg or similar
2. Add proper error boundaries and loading states
3. Enhance UI/UX with better feedback and animations
4. Add video thumbnail generation and preview features
